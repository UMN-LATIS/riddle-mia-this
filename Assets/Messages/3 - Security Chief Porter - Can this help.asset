  message: "One of our guards found some strange markings on a scrap of paper.  We
    can\u2019t read all the words - maybe filling in what\u2019s missing will help
    point us in the right direction.\r\n\r\nGo through the gate and turn left before
    the Scholar\u2019s Study (the studio of gratifying discourse) - the guard found
    the paper near the house of Wu.\r"

  mapHint: 'The answer can be found just opposite the entrance to the House of Wu
    (gallery G218). '
  puzzleHint: The stones are made for reflection - one has a silhouette that looks
    similar to the mark on the scrap of paper.
  answerHint: "The stone that matches the silhouette is the Scholar\u2019s Rock. This
    type of eroded rock is called a ying stone. The answer is \u201CYing\u201D"
