  message: "We\u2019re glad you made it.  We believe the museum has been infiltrated
    by members of the secret society Nulla Vectes. As you know, they believe that
    technology has severed our connection with reality and made us lose our appreciation
    for things like art. We believe they\u2019re close to completing a disruption
    device, which will render all electronic devices inoperable.  \n\nThey\u2019ve
    left behind a series of clues, hoping that like-minded individuals will be able
    to find them and join their cause. We need you to solve their riddles, and disable
    their device before it\u2019s too late!\n\nDon\u2019t forget to pick up your credentials
    from the welcome desk in the museum lobby (at the 3rd avenue entrance)! Thank
    you! You\u2019re our best chance at stopping them before it\u2019s too late!"
