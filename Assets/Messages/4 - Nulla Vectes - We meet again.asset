  message: "Hello again Professor Jones.  You could be a great ally for our cause.
    \ Have you considered joining?  You don\u2019t support the techno-plague any more
    than we do.  How about we give you the chance to join us and embrace the tranquility.
    \ Go through the stone gate towards the columns and turn left.  Past the calming
    water and left to the plains of Africa, we seek only quiet.\r\n\r\nOh, and if
    you choose not to join?  We\u2019ll destroy you.  But we\u2019ll throw you a beautiful
    funeral, with a fantastic coffin.  You\u2019ll just need to let us know where
    to send the flowers.\r"

  puzzleHint: Not all coffins look like coffins.  This one is a bit buggy.
  answerHint: "The answer is found on the Fantasy Coffin, which is a large green lobster.
    The answer is the PO Box written on the piece, \u201C343\u201D."
