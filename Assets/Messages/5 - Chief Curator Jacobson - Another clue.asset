  message: "A patron reported some \u201Cgraffiti\u201D in the atrium. From what they
    described, it might be the symbol of Nulla Vectes. Go past the masks and drums
    and take a right.  Follow the sign for the atrium, take a left at the totems and
    find your way.  Check the map if you get confused - there are some zigs and zags.
    The patron couldn\u2019t remember if they were on the second or third floor when
    they saw it, so keep your eyes peeled.   Maybe you can take a closer look and
    see if it\u2019s related to the plot that Nulla Vectes is hatching.  And remember
    - safety first!  No need to lean over the railing. After all, there are two sides
    to every coin."

  mapHint: Go to the atrium.
  puzzleHint: "The \u201Cgrafitti\u201D you\u2019re looking for is actually on the
    third floor.  You can see it from the second floor, but you\u2019ll need to head
    upstairs to get a closer look. Remember, it has two sides!"
  answerHint: "Use the camera f to examine the back of the graffiti on the third floor.
    \ It\u2019s on the wooden railing, facing gallery G379."
