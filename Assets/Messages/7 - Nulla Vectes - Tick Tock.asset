  message: "So, ready to join?  Avoid the Curator\u2019s Office and leave through
    the other door. Pass through gallery 368 and into the cursed modernity. Poor Ivan
    would have understood us. There is never enough time for art, especially when
    you\u2019re left balancing books all day. If only we could see into his soul. "

  mapHint: Go to gallery G367.
  puzzleHint: 'Look for the piece by Ivan Vasilievich Kliun. '
  answerHint: Ivan Vasilievich Kliun faced the dilemma of having to work a dull job
    to support himself and his family, instead of focusing on his art.  Use the camera
    to examine the painting The Clockmaker.  That will trigger the next clue, and
    reveal a hidden message.
