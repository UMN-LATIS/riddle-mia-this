  message: "Still following our clues eh?  Maybe you\u2019re still thinking about
    joining our cause?  You\u2019ll be too late to stop the disruption device, but
    you can join in our glory.  While you\u2019re here, consider Hans Ledwinka.  He
    was a great designer, but he was so hung up on technology instead of pure beauty.
