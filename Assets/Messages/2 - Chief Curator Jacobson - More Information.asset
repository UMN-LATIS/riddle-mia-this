  message: "We\u2019re still trying to piece together the clues we\u2019ve found.
    \ Our best guess is that the trail starts in gallery G200 - it\u2019s the open
    area on the second floor, near the windows facing the park.  Someone walked up
    to a docent and said \u201CThe universe leaves us hints, we just need to read
    the signs.  Basking in humility is the path to disruption.\u201D  We\u2019re not
    sure what it means.  Take the stairs or elevator up one level and see what you
    can find.  We\u2019ll be monitoring your progress along the way.\r"

  mapHint: "Make sure you\u2019re in gallery G200. It\u2019s on the second floor,
    above the lobby seating area. "
  puzzleHint: "You\u2019ll need to look up to find the characters you\u2019re seeking
    - they\u2019re carved in wood."
  answerHint: "If you stand in the Gate of Prosperity and look up, you\u2019ll see
    four characters.  These can be matched to four of the characters in the message.
    \ Select the first, second, third, and ninth characters, then push send. "
