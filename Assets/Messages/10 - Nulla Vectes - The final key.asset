    day is night and night is day.  You may be asking yourself: Why is all of this
    happening in this particular museum?  John Scott Bradstreet, one of those responsible

    of Art founded a third organization as well.  We are preserving his legacy to
    this day.  Reflect on the goodness of his work, relaxing by the north shore.'
