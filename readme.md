# Riddle Mia This Open Source Release

This is a very preliminary release of [Riddle Mia This](https://new.artsmia.org/riddle-mia-this/) and augmented reality puzzle room experience set in the Minneapolis Institute of Art.

In order to make use of this project, it'll be helpful to have a familiarity with the Unity game engine.  If you're just getting started in Unity, we highly recommend the [Lynda tutorials](https://www.lynda.com/Unity-training-tutorials/1242-0.html).

**Beware of Spoilers** - If you haven't already played Riddle Mia This, reading the code is going to ruin the fun!  Go play it first if you can!

## Setup

In order to use this project, you'll also need an account with [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com).  A free developer account will be fine to get started.  We'd recommend reading through the [Vuforia Unity Getting Started Guide](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/getting-started-with-vuforia-in-unity.html) to understand how to configure Unity.

## More to Come

We're exploring options for making the "augmented reality puzzle room experience" more user friendly and accessible to any type of institution.  For now, we wanted to get the code out so you can begin exploring.
